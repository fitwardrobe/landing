# The 7 R's of Fashion Explained: Your Guide to a Sustainable Wardrobe

Fashion is one of the most polluting industries on Earth. But you don't have to stop loving clothes to be sustainable. You just need a new framework.

Enter the **7 R's of Fashion**.

Most people know "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." But true sustainable style goes deeper. Here is the complete breakdown of the 7 R's and how a digital wardrobe app like [FitWardrobe](https://fitwardrobe.me) helps you practice them daily.

---

## 1. Reduce (Buying Less)

The most effective step. Stop impulse buying.
**How FitWardrobe helps:** Before you buy, check the app. Do you already own 5 black t-shirts? Seeing your inventory reduces the urge to duplicate.

## 2. Reuse (Rewearing is Cool)

Normalize repeating outfits. The most sustainable garment is the one already in your closet.
**How FitWardrobe helps:** Track your "Cost Per Wear." The more you wear an item, the cheaper (and greener) it becomes.

## 3. Repair (Mending > Tossing)

A lost button or small tear shouldn't be a death sentence for a shirt. Learn basic sewing or find a tailor.
**Tip:** [Visible mending](https://www.google.com/search?q=visible+mending) (like Sashiko) is a trendy way to repair denim.

## 4. Rent (Borrowing for Occasions)

Need a gown for a gala? Don't buy it to wear once. Rent it.
This keeps high-impact items in circulation and out of landfills.

## 5. Resell (Circular Economy)

If you truly don't wear it, give it a second life. Sell on Depop, Poshmark, or Vinted.
**How FitWardrobe helps:** Use your "Least Worn" filter to identify items to sell. The app already has a photo ready to upload!

## 6. Recycle (Textile Recycling)

When clothing is truly worn out (stained, ripped beyond repair), do NOT throw it in the trash. Look for textile recycling bins or programs like H&M's garment collection or specialised sneaker recycling.

## 7. Repurpose (Upcycling)

Turn old jeans into shorts. Tie-dye a stained white tee. Use old cotton shirts as cleaning rags. Creativity extends the lifecycle of fabric.

## Why Is This Important?

The fast fashion model relies on you buying clothes, wearing them ~7 times, and throwing them away.
By following the 7 R's, you:

- Save money.
- Reduce waste.
- Build a unique personal style that isn't dictated by passing trends.

## Making Sustainability Easy with Tech

Living sustainably takes effort. **FitWardrobe** lowers the friction.

- **Impulse Control:** Checking your digital closet in a store stops redundant purchases.
- **Wear Tracking:** Gamify your rewearing. Try to get every item to 30 wears (The [30 Wear Rule](https://fitwardrobe.me/blog/30-wear-rule.html)).
- **Organization:** When you know what you have, you take better care of it.
