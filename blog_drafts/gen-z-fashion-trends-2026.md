# Gen Z Fashion Trends 2026: Old Money, Blokecore & How to Style Them

Fashion moves fast. If you’re still wearing skinny jeans, you might be out of touch.
Gen Z has redefined style with hyper-specific "cores" and aesthetics. You don't have to adopt them fully, but understanding them can refresh your look.

Here are the top **Gen Z trends of 2026** and how to incorporate them without looking like you're trying too hard, using your digital wardrobe app to test the waters.

## 1. Old Money Aesthetic (Quiet Luxury)

**What it is:** Think Ralph Lauren, tennis skirts, cable-knit sweaters, and loafers. It’s about appearing wealthy through understated, high-quality basics. No big logos.
**Key Pieces:** Trench coat, white linen shirt, pearls, boat shoes.
**How to Style:** Pair a crisp white shirt with tailored trousers.
**Digital Tip:** Create an "Old Money" collection in [FitWardrobe](https://fitwardrobe.me) using your existing neutrals. You likely already own 90% of this look.

## 2. Blokecore

**What it is:** British lad culture meets vintage sportswear. It’s soccer jerseys (football kits), Adidas Sambas, and straight-leg jeans.
**Key Pieces:** Vintage oversized jersey, track jacket, dad sneakers.
**How to Style:** Tuck a jersey into jeans or wear it over a hoodie.
**Digital Tip:** Identify any sportswear in your closet. Tag it "Blokecore" to see if you can pull an outfit together.

## 3. Y2K Revival (Still Going Strong)

**What it is:** Early 2000s nostalgia. Low-rise jeans, baby tees, butterfly clips, and velour tracksuits.
**Key Pieces:** Baggy cargo pants, cropped cardigans, rimless sunglasses.
**How to Style:** Balance baggy pants with a fitted top.
**Digital Tip:** Check your "Archives." You might have authentic Y2K pieces from actual 2003 stored away!

## 4. Gorpcore

**What it is:** Functional hiking gear worn as high fashion. North Face jackets, cargos, hiking boots. "Gorp" = Good Old Raisins and Peanuts (trail mix).

## How to Try Trends Without Breaking the Bank

Don't overhaul your wardrobe for a trend that lasts 6 months.
**Use the Sandwich Rule:**
Balance a trendy item between two classic items.

- **Top:** Classic White Tee
- **Bottom:** Trendy Cargo Pants (Y2K)
- **Shoes:** Classic White Sneakers

**Use FitWardrobe to "Shop Your Closet":**
Before buying a trend piece:

1.  Search your digital inventory for similar items (e.g., search "vest" for Gorpcore).
2.  Create potential outfits with the hypothetical new item.
3.  If it only matches 1 thing, **don't buy it.**
