# The 90/90 Rule for Decluttering & How to Apply It to Your Closet

Closets have a bad habit of filling themselves. You blink, and suddenly you have 4 pairs of identical black pants.

If you struggle to let things go, you need a rule.
**The 90/90 Rule** is the gold standard for minimalists (popularized by The Minimalists, Joshua Fields Millburn & Ryan Nicodemus).

Here is how it works and how to apply it digitally with **[FitWardrobe](https://fitwardrobe.vercel.app)**.

## What is the 90/90 Rule?

Ask yourself these two simple questions about any item:

1.  **Have I used this item in the last 90 days?**
    - If **No**, ask the second question.
2.  **Will I use it in the next 90 days?**
    - If **No**, get rid of it.

If the answer to both is "No," the item is actively cluttering your life. It is serving no purpose. Let it go.

**Exceptions:** Seasonal items (winter coats in July) and sentimental items/formal wear (wedding dress). But apply strictly to everyday clothes.

## Why Use FitWardrobe for the 90/90 Rule?

Memory is unreliable. You _think_ you wore that sweater recently, but you actually wore it last Christmas.
**FitWardrobe** removes the guesswork with **Wear Statistics**.

### 1. Identify Ghosts

Open your "Least Worn" filter. The app will literally show you items with "0 wears" in the last 3 months.

- **Action:** Try them on. If they don't fit or you hate them, toss immediately.

### 2. The Next 90 Days

Look at your calendar. Do you have an event coming up in the next 3 months where you _really_ will wear those sequin pants?

- **Yes:** Keep them. Plan the outfit now in the app to commit to it.
- **No:** Donate/Sell.

### 3. The "Hanger Trick" (Digital Version)

In physical closets, you turn hangers backward. When you wear something, turn it forward. After 6 months, backward hangers go.
In **FitWardrobe**, just mark items as "Archived" if you aren't sure. If you don't un-archive them in 90 days, delete them permanently.

## Benefits of a Purged Closet

- **Less Stress:** Fewer choices = faster mornings.
- **Better Style:** You only wear what fits and flatters you.
- **More Space:** Physical and mental breathing room.
- **Sustainability:** Getting clothes to someone who will actually use them is better than hoarding them.

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h3 itemprop="name">Does this rule work for expensive items?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        Yes. Keeping an expensive dress you never wear doesn't bring the money back. It just reminds you of a mistake. Consider selling it on Poshmark to recoup some cost.

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        The rule adjusts. If it's summer, ignore winter coats. But apply the rule *within the season*. Haven't worn those shorts all summer? They go.

      <div itemprop="text">
        Ideally once a season. The 90/90 rule makes it a continuous habit rather than a huge yearly event.
