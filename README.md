## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is FitWardrobe really free?</b></summary>

Yes, completely. No subscriptions, no premium tiers, no ads. It's a passion project built by a solo developer.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do you see my photos?</b></summary>

No. Your clothing photos are stored on your device only. When AI analyzes an image, it's processed in-memory and never saved on any server.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I need to sign in if data is local?</b></summary>

Sign-in creates your unique identity for future features like optional cloud backup. Your wardrobe data stays on your device — we use your email solely to identify you, never to access your wardrobe.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate is the AI?</b></summary>

Our AI (powered by Google Gemini) accurately identifies clothing type, color, and style in most cases. You can always edit tags manually if something looks off.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I switch phones?</b></summary>

Use the **Export** feature to save your wardrobe as a file, then **Import** it on your new device. All your items, photos, and tags transfer over.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work offline?</b></summary>

Yes — browsing your wardrobe, filtering, and managing items works fully offline. AI features (analysis, outfit suggestions, chat) need an internet connection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens to my data if I uninstall?</b></summary>

All your data is deleted from your device. Make sure to **Export** your wardrobe first if you want to keep it. We don't have a copy — it was never on our servers.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I delete my account?</b></summary>

Go to **Settings → Delete Account**. This removes your cloud identity immediately. Your local data is cleared by uninstalling the app.

</details>

## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

FitWardrobe is built by a **solo indie developer** who was tired of:

- 🧥 Forgetting what clothes they owned
- ⏰ Wasting time planning outfits every morning
- 🔓 Apps that harvest your personal data for profit

This started as a personal project and grew into something others wanted too. It's free because good tools shouldn't cost money, and private because your wardrobe is nobody's business but yours.
