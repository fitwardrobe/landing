## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is FitWardrobe really free?</b></summary>
Yes, completely. No subscriptions, no premium tiers, no ads. It's a passion project.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do you see my photos?</b></summary>
No. Your clothing photos are stored on your device only. When AI analyzes an image, it's processed in-memory and never saved on any server.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I switch phones?</b></summary>
Use the Export feature to save your wardrobe as a JSON file, then Import it on your new device.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work offline?</b></summary>
Yes — browsing your wardrobe, filtering, and managing items works fully offline. AI features (analysis, outfit suggestions, chat) need an internet connection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I delete my account?</b></summary>
Go to Settings → Delete Account. This removes your cloud identity immediately. Your local data can be cleared by uninstalling the app.
