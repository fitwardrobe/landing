## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is FitWardrobe really free?</b></summary>

Yes, completely. No subscriptions, no premium tiers, no ads. It's a passion project built by a solo developer.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do you see my photos?</b></summary>

No. Your clothing photos are stored on your device only. When AI analyzes an image, it's processed in-memory and never saved on any server.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I need to sign in if data is local?</b></summary>

Sign-in creates your unique identity for future features like optional cloud backup. Your wardrobe data stays on your device — we use your email solely to identify you, never to access your wardrobe.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What if I switch phones?</b></summary>

Use the **Export** feature to save your wardrobe as a file, then **Import** it on your new device. All your items, photos, and tags transfer over.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work offline?</b></summary>

Yes — browsing your wardrobe, filtering, and managing items works fully offline. AI features (analysis, outfit suggestions, chat) need an internet connection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I delete my account?</b></summary>

Go to **Settings → Delete Account**. This removes your cloud identity immediately. Your local data is cleared by uninstalling the app.
